Wild card!
For this lab, it’s up to you to decide what you want to create!  You must submit the source code
for a program that runs and does something, but you decide what that is.  I’ll be looking for the
use of many of the concepts that we’ve covered this semester: linked lists, stacks, queues, malloc,
pointers, structures, arrays, etc.  You don’t have to use them all, but your program should be
advanced enough that it uses many (if not all).  If your program has a menu, you can use the
standard switch in a while loop that we’ve been using.  If your program does not, than make sure
that when I compile it it runs and something meaningful happens (output is generated, etc).
I’ll be grading on what your program does, how well you’ve constructed it and how much effort
you’ve put into it.  If you need help with some ideas, come talk to me and I’ll help you out!  Also,
feel free to explore more advanced topics (such as sockets), just make sure to use them correctly.  Good Luck!

Some ideas…
•	Create a reverse shell in C
•	Create a simulation – simulate a checkout line (NOTE:  YOU CANNOT use what has been demonstrated
    in class) or something else that would use a queue or a stack
•	Create a program that compares two files and determines if they’re identical or different
•	Use the internet for ideas, just don’t copy anything verbatim, I will check.


REMEMBER:  IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT COMPILE WHEN I DOWNLOAD AND COMPILE IT, YOU WILL LOSE ½ OF THE GRADE POSSIBLE.
Submit your program file (you choose the name) to the appropriate d2l dropbox.
