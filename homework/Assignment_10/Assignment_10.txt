For this assignment you may work in groups (2 or more per group) and submit identical files.
In order for me to grade your lab everyone must still submit their code through Dropbox as well
as have their groups name in a comment in the top of the source code file.  Failure to do this
will result in a 0 for this lab.  The purpose of this program is to create a program that can
query a file for specific information.  The program will use the nvdcve.dat file provided via
Dropbox.  Your program should have the following characteristics:

-	Should not end until a user selects the ‘Quit’ option from the menu
-	Use a struct to read/write data from/to the file
-	The ability to both read and write to the same file

I’ve provided a demo program, your program must provide AT A MINIMUM the functionality in this demo app.
However, please feel free to enhance as you see fit.

A hint about writing to the file…

-	Make sure to open the file in the correct mode, I recommend ‘a’.
-	You may find it easier when the user selects to add an entry to: close the current file pointer,
    open the file in the preceding mode (append), append to the file (fprintf),
    close the file, reopen in read only mode.
-	You can’t ‘break’ in a switch, use the exit function instead.
-	Want to clear the screen? Try: system(“clear”);


Submit your program file (inputOutput.c) to the appropriate d2l dropbox.

REMEMBER:  IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT COMPILE WHEN I DOWNLOAD AND COMPILE IT, YOU WILL LOSE ½ OF THE GRADE POSSIBLE.
