Your job will be to create a program that uses structures. You will create a structure that holds info about a computer file.
It must have a character array (up to 100 characters) to hold the name of the file. An integer to hold the size of the file.
It must also hold a character to hold the type of file (D for directory and F for file). Finally it must use a long to hold the
timestamp of the last time the file was accessed.

Part 1
In your main you should create a pointer to the structure, malloc memory for the structure, and
prompt/read in data about your structure. Do NOT print out the file info in the main.

Part 2
Write 1 function that prints out the contents of the file structure. Your function should have 1 parameter
which is a pointer to the file structure.

Below shows the expected output of running the program. Your output MUST match exactly the output below for the input from above.
The output of the print function is the last line of the output. There must be 1 newline at the end of the print function.

./a.out
Enter the type:D
Enter the filename:hello
Enter the access time:1234567890
Enter the size:24
Filename hello Size 24 Type[D] Accessed @ 1234567890


Submit your program file (structures.c) to the appropriate d2l dropbox.
REMEMBER:  IF YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT COMPILE WHEN I DOWNLOAD AND COMPILE IT, YOU WILL LOSE Â½ OF THE GRADE POSSIBLE.
